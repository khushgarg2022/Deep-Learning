# Deep-Learning: Image to Image Translation

## Project Description:
- Retrieved 1000 pairs of satellite-streetview images from the UC Berkeley's official directory of Pix2Pix Datasets.
- Developed a Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network for translating a Google Map Satellite image to a street-view image.
- Upgraded the architecture of the Pix2Pix generator to optimize the sigmoid cross-entropy loss and produce images closer to the ground truth.
- Monitored the live performance of the model where images were generated every 10 epochs and compared against expected target images.
- Evaluated whether the model required additional training as generated images started looking realistic after 50 training epochs.
